  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [205, 205, 'North']
  end
  version :full do
    process :resize_to_fit => [650, 650]
  end
  version :blog do
    process :resize_to_fit => [700, 300]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end
